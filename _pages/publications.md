: **Abstract—** 
When the culture and processes of software development companies do not support technical debt management, unintentional technical debt accumulates in the system and becomes excessive. Encouragement, dedicated time, and proper processes can reduce and avoid unintentional debt, and the skill of contextual ambidexterity can be applied by creating an encouraging context that supports technical debt management. However, existing literature discussing which contextual factors are required to achieve this skill is scarce, and practitioners call for approaches to reduce and avoid technical debt. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 48 papers to identify contextual factors for achieving contextual ambidexterity in knowledge-driven contexts. The results reveal seven categories of core and support contextual factors. This paper informs small- and medium-sized software development companies which contextual factors establish an encouraging context, and it theoretically examines the IT managers’ responsibility for technical debt management.

## Doctoral Thesis

**Achieving Contextual Ambidexterity in Software Development Companies - An Empirical Analysis to Resolve Social Debt**

The pace of technological development pressures companies to keep up with change. Especially industries, such as the software development industry, characterized by rapid technological advancements and low entry barriers that lead to fierce global competition are affected. Software development companies—especially in the beginning stages—need to bring new products and features quickly to the market for early customer feedback and to outpace competition.

A key challenge in software development is managing Technical Debt (TD). TD arises from trade-offs made to meet deadlines and expectations, often resulting in “_not quite right code_” or solutions that are “_good enough_” ([Cunningham, 1992](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/157710.157715)). Minimum viable products that are built early on will need rework and reengineering at a later time. The conscious (or oftentimes unconscious) decision to cut corners can incurr TD ([Ernst et al., 2021](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/5160/Technical-Debt-in-PracticeHow-to-Find-It-and-Fix)). While practitioners may or may not use the term in practice; the concept is a real-life challenge that developers have to deal with on a daily basis. 

However, when TD accumulates in a development community, it gives way to a "_not quite right development community_" ([Tamburri et al., 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235915753_What_is_Social_Debt_in_Software_Engineering)). At this point, an important social dimension of TD arises: **social debt** ([Riquet et al., 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3644384.3644473); [Caballero-Espinosa et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584922001872)). Tamburri and colleagues ([2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277355779_Social_debt_in_software_engineering_insights_from_industry)) have revealed a correlation between social debt and technical debt. This finding can be understood as teams that deal with social debt can start to struggle with quality issues that lead to further technical debt.

**In order to avoid unnecessary technical debt, it is therefore necessary to address social debt.**

Academic literature and practitioners agree that managing TD is a balancing act between **business reality** and **quality** ([Lim et al., 2012](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6280547); [Pressman & Maxim, 2019](https://g.co/kgs/aTL3KVU)). "Business reality" can be translated to speed and velocity of development to keep up with the pace on the market. On the one hand, speed and development velocity are essential for future business viability, while on the other hand, code quality and maintainability are crucial for future business scalability. Speed and quality are both equally crucial and need to be balanced in a fast-paced and turbulent market. However, both have opposing demands on the organizational environment. 

Balancing speed and quality is, at the bottom line, an individual skill that is fostered by the appropriate organizational context. For employees to balance speed and quality, the organization’s processes, structure, and culture have to support this endeavor. If the organizational context fails to support their employees and resists change, TD can accumulate and become unmanageable ([Kruchten et al., 2019](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/managing-technical-debt-reducing-friction-in-software-development/)). 

When looking into theory, organizations can balance opposing demands simultaneously through the capability known as organizational ambidexterity. A particular type discussed in the literature is contextual ambidexterity, which is the behavioral skill where people are able to balance opposing activities through their behavior. This behavior is evoked and enabled by the organizational context. ([Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20159573)) Achieving the skill of contextual ambidexterity may be applied to help software developers and IT managers to balance the opposing activities for speed and quality. Behavior cannot be directly controlled, but theory on organizational behavior has shown that organizational culture is a strong driver that influences behavior within an organization ([Mowday & Sutton, 1993](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.ps.44.020193.001211)). For the appropriate culture to arise, it is necessary to shape the organizational context accordingly.

This thesis uses the theoretical lens of contextual ambidexterity to examine how employees in software development companies can achieve a balance between speed and quality by looking at the essential contextual factors—such processes, structure, and culture—that influence and steer contextual behavior. By achieving contextual ambidexterity, software development companies can balance the opposing activities for speed and quality more efficiently and therefore avoid overwhelming amounts of TD. The focus of this study lies on small- and medium-sized software development companies, since they have more limited resources than large companies.

My goal is to contribute and advance the research in contextual ambidexterity while at the same time helping practitioners in the industry understand the contextual environment and behavioral capability in more detail, which allows for balancing speed and quality. Increasing velocity in software development while also concentrating on increasing software quality is necessary to remain viable in a fast-paced and competitive market.
