**Achieving Contextual Ambidexterity in Software Development Companies - An Empirical Investigation to Manage Technical Debt**

<!--
Nowadays the pace of technological development pressures companies to keep up with change. Especially industries, such as the software development industry which are characterized by rapid technological advancements and low entry barriers that lead to fierce and global competition are affected.


Especially in the beginning stages of software startups, they are forced to bring new product ideas quickly to the market for early customer feedback and to outpace competition. As the company grows and becomes more customer-focused, quick and dirty solutions for building minimum viable products will need rework and reengineering. 

Academic literature and practioners agree that 
Instead of taking on a reactive position to change, companies must play a proactive role when preparing for the future. They are required to remain flexible for the future while at the same time being efficient to leverage and capitalize on existing business. Ambidexterity describes the ability of a company to balance this mutual interplay. (O’Reilly et al. 2008, Tushman and O’Reilly 1996, Gibson and Birkinshaw 2004) Extant literature highlights multiple approaches to establishing the skill, one of them being contextual ambidexterity. Contextual ambidexterity depends on the organization’s environment to enable the simultaneous balance of efficiency and flexibility throughout the same company or business unit (Birkinshaw and Gibson 2004).
Collaboration and innovation are particularly critical for the success of software development companies, and the concept of contextual ambidexterity may ensure efficient collaboration while remaining flexible for rapid changes in the future (Ramesh et al. 2012). Albeit extant research, a general understanding of how contextual ambidexterity can be achieved remains unclear.

This research project focuses on software development companies and examines how to achieve balance between agility and reliability to efficiently manage technical debt. The implications 

improve and strengthen their ability to collaborate by achieving the skill of contextual ambidexterity. My goal is to contribute and advance the research in contextual ambidexterity while at the same time helping managing practitioners in the industry understand the contextual environment in more detail, that allows for collaboration and innovation to flourish.


As the concept of organizational ambidexterity is an academic construct (Birkenshaw and Raisch 2013), Systematic Literature Review (SLR) (Transfield et al. 2003; Kitchenham and Charters 2007) is conducted to identify relevant literature and underlying theory. A multiple case study method (Eisenhardt et al. 1989, Grodal et al. 2021) and expert interviews (Gläser and Laudel 2010) have been chosen as the empirical research methods for data collection.
