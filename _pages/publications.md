: **Abstract—** 
When the culture and processes of software development companies do not support technical debt management, unintentional technical debt accumulates in the system and becomes excessive. Encouragement, dedicated time, and proper processes can reduce and avoid unintentional debt, and the skill of contextual ambidexterity can be applied by creating an encouraging context that supports technical debt management. However, existing literature discussing which contextual factors are required to achieve this skill is scarce, and practitioners call for approaches to reduce and avoid technical debt. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 48 papers to identify contextual factors for achieving contextual ambidexterity in knowledge-driven contexts. The results reveal seven categories of core and support contextual factors. This paper informs small- and medium-sized software development companies which contextual factors establish an encouraging context, and it theoretically examines the IT managers’ responsibility for technical debt management.

## Doctoral Thesis

**The Role of Organizational Context in Technical Debt Management: A Multiple Case Study of Software Development Teams**

The pace of technological development pressures companies to keep up with change. Especially industries, such as the software development industry, characterized by rapid technological advancements and low entry barriers that lead to fierce global competition are affected. Software development companies—especially in the beginning stages—need to bring new products and features quickly to the market for early customer feedback and to outpace competition.

A key challenge in software development is managing technical debt. Technical debt arises from trade-offs made to meet deadlines and expectations, often resulting in “*not quite right code*” or solutions that are “*good enough*” ([Cunningham, 1992](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/157710.157715)). Minimum viable products that are built early on will need rework and reengineering at a later time. The conscious (or oftentimes unconscious) decision to cut corners can incur technical debt ([Ernst et al., 2021](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/5160/Technical-Debt-in-PracticeHow-to-Find-It-and-Fix)). While practitioners may or may not use the term in practice, the concept is a real-life challenge that developers have to deal with on a daily basis.

A development team does not strive to develop a debt-free system but rather a competitive one. ([Avgeriou et al., 2016](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/DagRep.6.4.110)). Therefore, proper technical debt management becomes even more crucial. Managing technical debt is not a one-time activity but rather a continuous and resource-intensive effort including many activities that should be integrated into the development process ([Kruchten et al., 2019](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/managing-technical-debt-reducing-friction-in-software-development/)). These activities are mostly directly related to the code base and the development process. While technical debt at its core is technical weaknesses, managing technical debt includes many non-technical aspects as well ([Martini et al., 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9976055/?arnumber=9976055)). Software is not created in isolation, but engineers, architects, designers, and managers work in close collaboration with each other. Therefore, the organizational context that the team is working in needs to be equipped to support these management activities. A lack of proper processes, structure, and culture can result in unintentional technical debt that accumulates unknowingly ([Tom et al. 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121213000022); [Kruchten et al., 2019](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/managing-technical-debt-reducing-friction-in-software-development/)). Especially when emerging companies want to grow and scale their business, their organizational contexts need to be shaped in a way that supports this endeavor. As noted by Ernst et al. ([2021](https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/5160/Technical-Debt-in-PracticeHow-to-Find-It-and-Fix)), often failure comes not from inferior technology but from a destructive organizational context.

According to Ghoshal and Bartlett ([1994](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.4250151007)), organizational context is the systems, processes, and beliefs that influence the individual behavior within an organization. The context enables the behavior of a team and shapes the organization’s culture. Behavior cannot be directly controlled, but research on organizational behavior has shown that organizational culture is a strong driver that influences behavior within an organization ([Mowday & Sutton, 1993](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.ps.44.020193.001211)). For the appropriate culture to arise, it is necessary to shape the organizational context accordingly.

Although scholars discussed how technical debt management is influenced by aspects of the organizational context ([Ramasubbu and Kemerer, 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8114229/); [Besker et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921001907?via%3Dihub); [Kruchten et al., 2019](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/managing-technical-debt-reducing-friction-in-software-development/)), empirical research on how the organizational context can be leveraged by the development team is lacking. Avgeriou et al. ([2016](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/DagRep.6.4.110)) point out that more research is necessary on which contextual factors are crucial in supporting the team to manage technical debt. This not only includes the processes and systems but also structural and cultural factors. Researchers call for further empirical research ([Tom et al. 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121213000022);[Izurieta et al. 2016]();[Besker et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921001907?via%3Dihub)), and practitioners request viable measures to guide them in leveraging their organizational context.

This dissertation researches the role of organizational context in technical debt management and provides as a result a practical framework that can be used by software development teams. The framework brings awareness and helps development teams to reshape their organizational context in a way that improves and supports technical debt management activities.

This thesis is based on the theory of systems engineering and the theoretical lens of contextual ambidexterity to examine how a software development team and improve their technical debt management from a bottom-up approach by using the organizational context as an influential factor to steer behavior.

Academically, the expected findings contribute to a better understanding of how organizational context can be leveraged to support technical debt management. Comprehending how organizational contexts of established development teams supports engineers and managers to manage technical debt more effectively, contributes to the existing research on technical debt management. In practice, the resulting framework helps software development teams to leverage their organizational context to manage technical debt. The framework guides teams in a bottom-up approach to reshape and influence crucial contextual factors to improve and support their technical debt management. The framework provides a viable measure practitioners can use to leverage their organizational context to manage technical debt.
