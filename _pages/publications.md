**Achieving Contextual Ambidexterity in Software Development Companies - An Empirical Investigation to Manage Technical Debt**

Nowadays, the pace of technological development pressures companies to keep up with change. Especially industries, such as the software development industry, characterized by rapid technological advancements and low entry barriers that lead to fierce and global competition are affected. Software development companies - especially in the beginning stages - need to bring new products and features quickly to the market for early customer feedback and to outpace competition.

Quick and dirty solutions or functionality that is “good enough” ([Cunningham 1992](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/157710.157715)) for building minimum viable products will need rework and reengineering at a later time. The conscious (or sometimes unconscious) decision to cut corners is known as technical debt. The additional effort and cost required to write high-quality and reliable code are pushed back to when the company can “afford” the additional cost it will take (either financially, expertise-wise, or other). Sometimes incurring technical debt is used as a strategic tool to stay agile, reduce time to market, and get feedback quickly. However, failure to manage incurred technical debt can have long-term detrimental consequences as the cost of change increases exponentially.

Academic literature and practitioners agree that managing technical debt is a balancing act ([Lim et al. 2012](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6280547), [Pressman & Maxim 2019](https://g.co/kgs/aTL3KVU)). On the one side code-quality and maintainability are crucial to reliability, while on the other side speed and productivity are essential to agility. Reliability and agility are both equally crucial to remain successful in a fast-paced and turbulent market. However, both have opposing - sometimes even contradicting - demands. Turning to theory, the ability of organizations to balance opposing demands simultaneously is known as organizational ambidexterity. A particular type discussed in the literature is contextual ambidexterity, which is the behavioral capability for opposing demands enabled by the organizational context ([Gibson & Birkinshaw 2004](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20159573)). Achieving the skill of contextual ambidexterity may help software development companies to balance the opposing demands of reliability and agility.

This research project focuses on software development companies and examines how to achieve the balance between agility and reliability to efficiently manage technical debt. My goal is to contribute and advance the research in contextual ambidexterity while at the same time helping managing practitioners in the industry understand the contextual environment and behavioral capability in more detail, which allows for balancing agility and reliability and ultimately, managing technical debt.
