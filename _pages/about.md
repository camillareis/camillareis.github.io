Hi! My name is Camilla and I'm a university assistant at the [Institute of General Management and Organisation](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ufo/home) at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home) in Austria. Prior to this position, I studied **Software Engineering - Management** at TU Graz and received my master's degree in 2021.


In case you are wondering, _"What does a university assistant do?"_

Basically, it's teaching and research combined while working on a PhD.

I co-teach lectures and seminars for undergraduate and MBA programs, assist with exams, and supervise Bachelor’s and Master’s theses at the Institute. For an overview what I teach, check out my [teaching page](https://camillareis.github.io/teaching/).

In addition to teaching, I contribute to research projects, with a focus on **technology-based business models and circular business models, technology management, and organizational ambidexterity**. As a 3rd-year PhD candidate, I’m actively working on my dissertation. For more details, check out my teaching and research pages. If you're curious, take a look at my [research and publications page](https://camillareis.github.io/reserach-publications/).
