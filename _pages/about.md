Hi! My name is Camilla and I'm a university assistant at the [Institute of General Management and Organisation](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ufo/home) at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home) in Austria. Prior to this position, I studied **Software Engineering - Management** at TU Graz and received my master's degree in the end of 2021.


In case you are wondering, _"What does a university assistant do?"_ 

I am part of the teaching team and co-responsible for various lectures and seminars for undergraduate and MBA degree programs. For more details on which courses I teach, check out my [teaching page](https://camillareis.github.io/teaching/). As a teaching assistant my responsibilites include organizing and processing lecture exams, and supervising Bachelor's and Master's Thesis.

Besides teaching, I also participate in research projects at the institute. My research interests are widely spread, but my foci lie in technology-based business models, technology management and organizational ambidexterity. I'm also a doctoral student and working on my dissertation. If you're curious, take a look at my [research and publications page](https://camillareis.github.io/reserach-publications/).

Managing all tasks, responsibilities and interests simulataneously can be overwhelming, so I have many systems and digital organization tools that support me in not losing track and work efficiently. I am currently working on blog posts about the best digital research tools and organization tips, so stay tuned.


In sum, my _passion for teaching and education_ characterizes me as a university assistant. My _curiosity and self-motivation_ drive me as a doctoral student. And my _love for digital planning and organization tools_ helps me work solution-oriented and efficiently.
