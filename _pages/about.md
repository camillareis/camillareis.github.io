Hi! My name is Camilla and I'm a university assistant at the Institute of General Management and Organisation at Graz University of Technology in Austria. Prior to this position, I studied Software Engineering - Management at TU Graz and received my master's degree in the end of 2021.  <br /> 

You might be thinking, what does a university assistant do? <br />
I am a part of the teaching team and co-responsible for various lectures and seminars from the institute. For more details on which courses I teach, check out my teaching page. As a teaching assistant my responsibilites include organizing and processing lecture exams, and supervising Bachelor's and Master's Thesis. <br />
Besides teaching, I also participate in research projects at the institute. My research interests are widely spread, but my foci lie in technology-based business models, technology management and organizational ambidexterity. I'm also a doctoral student and working on my dissertation. If you're curious, take a look at my research and publications page. <br />
Managing all tasks, responsibilities and interests simulataneously can be overwhelming, so I have many systems and organization tools that support me in not losing track. <br />

In summary: <br />
My **passion for teaching and education** characterizes me as a university assistant. <br />
My **curiosity and self-motivation** drive me as a doctoral student. <br />
My **love for digital planning and organization tools** helps me work solution-oriented and efficiently. <br />
